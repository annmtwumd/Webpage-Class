	<p>Cupcakes are small cakes designed to serve one person, which may be baked in a small thin paper or aluminum cup. They are much quicker (and easier) to make than regular cakes. It's basically just eating a mini cake just for you! </p>
	
	<p>Cupcakes are made for so many fun events. They can be baked for birthday parties, weddings, graduation parties, and so many more special events. People make varieties of cupcakes; the most common is vanilla, but there is also chocolate, 
	funfetti, cookies and cream, strawberry, and more. </p> 
	
	<p>Making these yummy treats is very fun and easy to do! Simple make the batter with your basic ingredients of eggs, milk, flour, vanilla extract, etc. Then,
	if you want a specific flavor, add that into the mixture like chocolate chips or cranberries. Anything you add to your cupcake will make it even more delicious. </p>
